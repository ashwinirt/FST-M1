"""
Activity 23: Fixtures

Using pytest:
    Create a new test file and do the following:
        Create a fixture that initializes a list containing numbers from 0-10.
        Write a test method asserting that the sum of that list is 55
        Once you confirm that the test passes, move the fixture into the conftest.py file and rerun the test.

    # Create list
    int_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]    
    # Alternatively
    # int_list = list(range(11))
    return int_list

    # Initialize sum
    sum = 0
    # Add number in the list
    for n in num_list:
        sum += n
    # Assertion
    assert sum == 55
